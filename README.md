# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

For my portfolio project I had to create a responsive design that ensures web applications will render on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. 

My framework:



* First I created the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` with a basic HTML template. Then, using Bootstrap, I developed my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar that was consistant on each page.

   * Every link that you can click works and goes to it's respective page.

   * Attempted to use semantic HTML but was a little thrown off with trying to integrate that with bootstrap.

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   * I used the Bootstrap grid system to adjust my navbar, specific cards, and social media links.
I also used a code validator to clean up my html, although I was unable to fix my footer issue.

* I utilized sub-row and sub-columns while creating my about me card.


Over all this was a challenging project that really made me think hard about how I can utilize bootstraps grid system.
